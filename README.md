# Web Application Architecture - Final Projects

1. Folder 1_drawing_app and 2_drawing_app are exaclty the same. 
It is juste to respect the submission name request by the teacher as assigment 1 and 2 used the same based.
2. For the drawing app, I chose to keep my own template but I didn't kept all the TD assignment.
I used Atlas database to hoast the drawing app. It is not a secure db but it wasn't require here.
4. For the movie quizz, please spell correctly the names/films title. Only original title are recognize. 
I am using tbmb API and it is possible that some films are missing in their databse.
