# Web Application and Architecture Project

1. Folder 1_drawing_app and 2_drawing_app are exaclty the same. 
It is juste to respect the submission name request by the teacher as assigment 1 and 2 used the same based.
2. For the drawing app, I chose to keep my own template but I didn't kept all the TD assignment.
3. I used Atlas database to hoast the drawing app. It is not a secure db but it wasn't require here.
